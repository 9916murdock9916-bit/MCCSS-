## Answer to Your Specific Question

### "Is any of this classified?"

**ANSWER: NO - COMPLETELY UNCLASSIFIED**

**Why**:
- Uses only public NIST standards (NIST SP 800-53, NIST CSF 2.0)
- Encryption algorithms are NSA-approved (AES-256-GCM is public, ITAR-approved)
- Architecture patterns are documented in public research
- Open-source framework (code available for government review)
- FEDRAMP certification path uses public procedures

**What this means**:
- ✓ Can be briefed to Congress without classification
- ✓ Can be shared with international Five Eyes allies
- ✓ Open-source audit trail (anyone can review security)
- ✓ No export controls on framework itself (only on classified data)
- ✓ Safe for government websites and procurement discussions

**For classified systems later**:
- Framework can be adapted to classified environment
- Same architecture, additional hardening
- Would be separately classified (framework itself remains unclassified)
