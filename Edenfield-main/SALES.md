# Sales and outreach playbook

Target agencies

- Agencies with cross-jurisdiction data needs: DHS, HHS, DoD (selected components), state emergency management

Materials

- One-pager: `PITCH.md`
- Technical appendix: `GOVERNANCE.md`
- Compliance checklist: `NIST-COMPLIANCE.md` (already included)

Engagement steps

1. Prepare a short demo (hosted locally or in a controlled cloud tenant)
2. Provide an architecture and compliance briefing (NIST/FedRAMP posture)
3. Offer a 90-day pilot with clear acceptance criteria
4. Negotiate a licensing arrangement and support terms

Security and governance

- Emphasize the audit log (`audit.log`) and lease model for separations of duty.

Templates

- Outreach email and briefing decks should be produced from these materials.
