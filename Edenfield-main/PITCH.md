# Eden Field — One-page pitch

Purpose

- Provide a resilient, privacy-preserving distributed substrate for federated data sharing across government agencies.
- Enforce fine-grained tenant controls, leases, and auditable governance for delegated administrations.

Key strengths

- Multi-tenant leases and organism-scoped admin rights.
- Append-only audit logs for governance events.
- Offline-first sync with conflict resolution.
- Minimal dependencies and easy packaging for restricted environments.

Why government agencies should care

- Helps agencies cooperate without exposing raw tenant data to platform operators.
- Meets needs for compartmentalization, least privilege, and traceability.

Next steps for pilots

- NDA and MOU
- Small pilot with 1-2 agencies (30–90 days)
- Instrumentation and compliance checklist (FedRAMP / NIST readiness)
